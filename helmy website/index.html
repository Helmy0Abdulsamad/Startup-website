                                 Information security analysts are tasked with analyzing a system and making it safe from various kinds of cyber security risks. In carrying out their duties, they need to think creatively and carefully to ensure there are no loopholes that endanger the system they are working on.

                                 All types of businesses and online activities will not be possible without the support of various kinds of software. Therefore, all parties involved in software development will have brilliant career potential in the future.
                                 Software development is more complicated than just web development. In addition to programming, there are various other aspects that should be considered as well, such as specification, testing, and operational needs.

                                 At least a bachelor's degree in computer science is required to be able to pursue a career as a computer hardware engineer.  
                                 In addition, you will also be required to be proficient in various types of programming languages. However, the most important skills mastered are analytical, technical, and communication skills.

                                 Everything you work on a computer depends on hardware and software. For example, today you can view this lesson in a web browser (software) and use the mouse (hardware) to move from one page to another. 
                                 if you learn about the different types of computers, ask yourself about the differences in hardware. As you study this guide, you will understand the wide variety of computers as well as the wide variety of software they use.
